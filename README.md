# `elm-2d-scene`

**Development of `elm-2d-scene` is currently on hiatus. The project that I was using it for has switched to an
SVG-based renderer, which I think is

cases.**

ðŸš§ This page is under construction. `elm-2d-scene` is not ready for use. ðŸš§

A WebGL-based 2D rendering library that requires no knowledge of WebGL to use.
